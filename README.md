# Github-to-Portfolio-Generator
A program which gets access to your GitHub account and creates a basic webpage structure about your projects
## The Idea?
The Idea came from when a friend told me to send my portfolio via email, I replied that I dont really have one but you can check it out on my github page. I felt guilt and needed to make this for my personal use, which will be free to the public to use.
